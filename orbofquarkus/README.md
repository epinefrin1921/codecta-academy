Few tips:

You can add your costum monsters, characters, maps, dungeons (almost entire game is costum made)...

When adding new dungeon, you can add monsterId and powerUpId, but you do not have to.

When player is located in one dungeon, player has to beat monster before moving or going back.
If monster is not beaten, player can only move by fleeing, and player will lose 50% of health and strength, 100 score points and all powerups.
If player founds ORB powerup, players has to use it and game will end with outcome WON.
If player's health drops below 0, game will end with outcome LOSE.
